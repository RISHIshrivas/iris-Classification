# iris-Classification
 The "Iris Classification" project employs machine learning to categorize iris flowers based on sepal and petal measurements. This model, built using scikit-learn, showcases the application of classification algorithms to differentiate between Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica species.

## Overview

The Iris Classification model is designed to classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. This project serves as a beginner-friendly example of implementing a machine learning classification task using popular Python libraries.
